        In 2017, before I began my studies at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang
        Technological University, I had my first exposure to programming.
        Initially, my focus was on pursuing a career in finance, so I decided to
        start with Microsoft Excel VBA, considering it a valuable asset in the
        finance field.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progressed through my academic journey, my perspective began to
        shift. During my last semester in 2021, I had a realization that my true
        passion lay in programming, not finance. This epiphany prompted me to
        make a career switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fully explore my newfound interest, I took a semester off from my
        studies to immerse myself in programming. During this time, I secured an
        internship at a fintech company as a support role, but later
        transitioned into a programming position within the same company.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of 2021, upon completing my degree, I officially embraced the
        role of a web developer. Since then, I've been continuously honing my
        skills, exploring new technologies, and working on personal projects in
        my free time.
