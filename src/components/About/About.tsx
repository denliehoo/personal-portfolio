      <p>
        My name is Denlie Hoo. I'm a software engineer, specializing in
        full-stack web and blockchain development. My expertise includes React
        for frontend; Node.js and MongoDB for backend; and Solidity for
        blockchain. My professional experiences revolve around Fintech,
        Cryptocurrency, and Web3.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started programming with Microsoft Excel VBA before my studies at
        Nanyang Business School in 2017, initially aiming for a career in
        finance. But during my final year, I discovered my true passion for
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a semester off, interned at a fintech company, and transitioned
        to a programming role after graduating in 2021. Since then, I've been
        committed to honing my skills, exploring new technologies, and working
        on personal projects in my free time.
