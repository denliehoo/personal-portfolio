        My name is Denlie Hoo. I’m a Software engineer specialised in full-stack
        web development and blockchain development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mainly use is React for the frontend, Node.js and MongoDB for the
        backend and Solidity for blockchain development. My professional
        experience mainly revolves around the Fintech, Cryptocurrency and Web3
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, before I began my studies at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang
        Technological University, I had my first exposure to programming.
        Initially, my focus was on pursuing a career in finance and decided to
        learn Microsoft Excel VBA, considering it a valuable skill in finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progressed through my academic journey, my perspective began to
        shift. During my last semester in 2021, I had a realization that my true
        passion lay in programming, not finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a semester off from university to immerse myself in programming.
        During this time, I secured an internship at a fintech company as a
        support role, but later transitioned into a programming position within
        the same company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completing my degree at the end of 2021, I officially embraced the
        role of a web developer. Since then, I've been continuously honing my
        skills, exploring new technologies, and working on personal projects in
        my free time.
