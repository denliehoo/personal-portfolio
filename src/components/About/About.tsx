        My name is Denlie Hoo. I’m a Software engineer specialised in full-stack
        web development and blockchain development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mainly use React for the frontend, Node.js and MongoDB for the backend
        and Solidity for blockchain development. My professional experience
        revolves around the Fintech, Cryptocurrency and Web3 industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I began my studies at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang
        Technological University, in 2017, I had my first exposure to
        programming. Initially, my focus was on pursuing a career in finance. I
        decided to learn Microsoft Excel VBA, considering it a valuable skill in
        finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progressed through my academic journey, my perspective shifted.
        During my last year, I had a realization that my true passion lay in
        programming, not finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a semester off from university to immerse myself in programming.
        During this time, I secured an internship at a fintech company as a
        support role, and was given the opportunity to transition into a
        programming role after graduation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completing my degree at the end of 2021, I officially embraced the
        role of a web developer. Since then, I've been continuously honing my
        skills, exploring new technologies, and working on personal projects in
        my free time.
